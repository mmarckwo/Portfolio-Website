        <h1>IMCU Board Game</h1>
        <p>A digital board game for a credit union about financial literacy.</p>

        I worked in a team of 3 other members to create a prototype of a game for Indiana Members Credit Union (IMCU). This was my first time working with a real-world client. We communicated regularly with the client to come up with a game to suit their needs. They wanted an educational game to teach people around ages 18 - 25 financial literacy.
        </p>
        <p class="text">What we came up with is a mobile app board game that can be played between 2 - 4 players. Players have to travel to the end of the board whilst making wise financial decisions, avoiding debt, and staying out of jail. Players have to manage their money between their savings and checking accounts and keep themselves safe from loan sharks and other scams. At some spots on the board, a player will receive a scenario card. The scenario card describes a scene and the player has to choose between actions to take for the scenario. Players have to use their best judgement to determine what the best option is. Will they make the right choice? 
        </p>
        <p class="text">Scenario cards are based off of events that are likely to happen in the real world. They're meant to make players recognize what good and bad opportunities look like and what the consequences of their decisions could lead to. The managment of a savings and checking account in the game also familiarizes inexperienced players with operating such accounts and how they work.
        </p>

        This project was focused on design work. I worked with my team to create the game concept and the game rules. I made the gameplay design for the prototype, which can be viewed in the section below. I contributed some scenario cards and game mechanics regarding checking and savings accounts. 
        <br>A sample of those contents can be viewed here: <b><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/155Ok_BknOdKmegogWuK366TEL3pnqhFkdSNUycxizA8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Doc Sample</a></b>
        <br>The layout of the prototype looks like this: <div class="general-image"><img src="images/prototype_preview.png"></div>

        Here is a link to the prototype made in Adobe Xd. Because it is a prototype, it uses fixed choices and outcomes.
