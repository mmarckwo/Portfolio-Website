      Alien Escape is a game where two players must work together to escape a
      facility that they've been captured into. It's a puzzle game with some
      elements of physics. Players must navigate the rooms and use and share
      items that they find along the way by throwing them to each other.
      <br />Such items include keys, a flashlight, an umbrella, a hammer, and a
      teleporter.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      The game is networked via Photon Fusion. I had to teach myself how to do
      multiplayer networking with Fusion from scratch over the course of 6
      months, all while developing an interesting game behind it. All assets are
      custom-made by me, with the exception of sounds and music.

      both players. <br />Audio comes from the left player.
