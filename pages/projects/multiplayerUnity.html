        This game was made by a team of 4 members (including myself).
        <br />It's a game where 3 players need to outrun and defend themselves
        from the 1 enemy player. The enemy player has to chase and catch the
        running players, but the running players can use traps and doors to slow
        the chasing player down. The buttons are only on one side of the door,
        so you're able to cut off players who are chasing you. <br />The game
        was networked using Photon PUN.
      </p>

      <div class="header2"><h2>My Contribution</h2></div>
      <p class="text">
        I developed the doors in this game. Every door is tied to a button that
        opens and closes the door. The button is green when the door is open,
        and turns red when it's closed. The buttons and doors are networked so
        that the toggle occurs in every player's instance of the game; players
        can see other players opening and closing doors.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
        I also sourced all the audio in this game, both the sound effects and
        the music (though I did not implement them).
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        The music is from
        <a href="https://incompetech.com/" target="_blank"
          ><b>incompetech.com</b></a
        >
        and the sound effects were taken from
        <a href="https://freesound.org/" target="_blank"
          ><b>freesound.org</b></a
        >
      </p>

        Gameplay footage. Again, the door functionality was made by me, and all
        of the sounds and music were found by me.
        <br />(Gameplay begins at 1:26. Also, my voice is not present in this.
        Commentary is provided by the other 3 team members.)
