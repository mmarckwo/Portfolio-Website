        <p class="text">
            Mix of Ages is a 4-player board game where players battle each other to prevent (or succeed in) the rewriting of history. <br>
            Players must defend their castle, claim spaces of land to use its resources, and strategically plan how to move their units and when to use their items.

        <p class="text">This game was developed by 3 people. 
        <br>My role was the game designer. I worked with the writer and artist to make the gameplay comply with the story.</p>
        <p class="text">I developed how the game is played. The game's main mechanics involve: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Castles</li>
            <li>Land resources</li>
            <li>Player troops</li>
            <li>Card items</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text">
        Players attack and defend castles to keep them in the game. If a player's castle is destroyed, then the player is out. Castles begin with a lot of health, so it's unlikely for a player to immediately lose. Castles can be fortified to have better defense as the game progresses.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
        Some spaces on the board contain resources that help the player who claimed the spot. Village spaces produce more units for the player, mines produce more money per round for the player, farms generate helpful items for the player to use, and airports, which were brought from the future, let a player travel from one area of the board to another quickly. 
        <br>Players must use the right items to claim a space of land. Players who are trying to take over another player's claimed space can steal it by force. 
        <br>One way to win the game is by having the most claimed spaces of land at the end of the game.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
        Players have their own troops to control. They can divide their units however they want to move around the board. The larger a group, the stronger it is. Sometimes, though, it's best to split up. Players move their troops to attack castles or to claim spaces in the land. If a player moves all of their troops away from their castle, it leaves the castle defenseless. Players must think carefully about how they want to divide their units and where to position themselves.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
        Card items are the items players have that they can use on their turn. Card items can be bought with money after every round. Certain card items can be made by combining two certain cards. These cards have various effects, so they can provide offense, defense, or health restoration. The items represented on the cards come from both the past and the future. Some cards feature swords, while others feature ray guns. While items from the future are much more powerful, they are also much more rare. It's up to you when the best time to use one is.

        </div>
        <p class="small-text">Cards are colored to match their type. Cards can be combined to make new cards too.</p>
        <p class="text">Cards are color coded to represent the kind of item they have. Blue cards are for defense, green cards are for health restoration, red cards are for offense, and brown cards are for miscellaneous items.</p>
        <p class="text">
        The above image on the right shows three cards being combined to create a new card. Alcohol, rag, and strength cards can be fused to make a molotov card item. Many card items can only be obtained through fusing, so you're likely to discover a new combination for each new game. 
        <br>A list of item combinations is available in the game.

        <p class="small-text">Coins, player tokens, and player flags.</p>
        <p class="text">Players place tokens representing their side around the board to show where they have placed their troops. A player's flag is placed on a space that has been claimed by them. The amount of coins generated per round for a player depends on what spaces they have claimed, in addition to a base amount.</p>

        <div class="header2"><h2>Development</h2></div>
        <p class="text">The game went through many iterations before it reached its final state. 
        <br>The game's development lasted for about a month.
        <br><br>Challenges I faced as the game designer include how to balance the game for each player, how player movement on the game board should work, and determining the winning conditions for a player.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
        These issues were overcame through frequent testing and iterating. If some cards were more powerful than others, I would adjust the card appropriately. 
        <br><br>The winning conditions were play tested to see if a player could unfairly win, and in the end the best results of winning were to either be the last player standing or by having the most spaced claimed spaces at the end of the game. That way, aggressive players won't be able to steal wins every game if there is more than one way to win.
        <br><br>Deciding player movement was the most difficult part. I initially had it too complex by needing to consider the size of a group to determine how many spaces they could move, but in the end a simple dice roll was sufficient to stop it from being too confusing.
