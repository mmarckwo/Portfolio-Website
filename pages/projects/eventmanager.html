      The Event Manager App is a CRUD application that was developed using HTML,
      jQuery, Sass, Node, and Firebase.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      The Event Manager App allows users to log in to or sign up with an
      account, either using the text field entries or their own Google account.
      Once an account is made, the user's data is stored into Firebase, a
      database service by Google. Users are then able to create and manage their
      own reminder notes for their accounts. Notes that the user creates are
      checked for errors before being uploaded to the database. If there are
      errors the user has made, it highlights which input fields need to be
      corrected.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      When a user successfully creates and uploads a note, they're able to see
      it on their note dashboard. From the dashboard, they can click on it to
      view all the information they have on the note. When viewing a note, the
      user is also able to update the information on it or delete it from the
      database.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      This is a full CRUD application. Users can create and upload their own
      notes, they can read and retrieve their notes from the database, they can
      edit and update the data on their notes, and they can delete notes they've
      made from the database.
