      <p>An online 2-player 1v1 arena battle.</p>
    </div>

      <p class="text">
        This game was made primarily by me, in Unity, with some code
        contributions by another team member.
        <br />It's a game where two players battle each other with spells to
        defeat the other player. Players earn points by killing the other player
        or pushing them off the arena. The first player to 3 points wins.
        <br />Players can cast 3 different spells.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          (Red) Attack Spell: A basic attack. Hit the other player to decrease
          their HP.
        </li>
        <li>
          (Light yellow) Impulse Spell: Pushes the hit player back with a strong
          force.
        </li>
        <li>
          (Blue) Speed Spell: Increase the hit player's speed. Use this to make
          the other player slip off with their gradually increasing speed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text">The game's networking was done by using Photon PUN.</p>

      <div class="header2"><h2>My Work</h2></div>
      <p class="text">
        I created most of the player controller and the player camera. I also
        created the spells and their effects on the other player. The items in
        levels and the menus were made by me as well. The sky level that appears
        in the video below was created by me. I made my own simple models with
        Blender and imported them to make a basic arena level.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
        The online networking for the game was done by me. Players can join a
        lobby that shows the rooms that are open to join. When a player makes a
        room, it appears in the room list. Then, any player is able to click
        that room and join that player's lobby. Players are also properly
        designated as the host or client player. Players get to control their
        own character. They're also able to attack the other player. The scoring
        system used in game is updated by both players and tells which player
        won and lost after one of them gets to three points.

        I am responsible for most of the scripting in the game.

      <p class="text">
        I also sourced and added all audio in the game, which includes sounds
        and music. <br />The music is from
        <a href="https://incompetech.com/" target="_blank"
          ><b>incompetech.com</b></a
        >
        and the sound effects were taken from
        <a href="https://freesound.org/" target="_blank"
          ><b>freesound.org</b></a
        >

        Side-by-side gameplay footage of one player battling another player.
        This was recorded on two separate computers and then they had their
        recordings merged into one video.
