      This website was designed and developed by me along with some work between
      another IUPUI student and a web professor from Haaga-Helia, a university
      in Helsinki, Finland.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      The website exemplifies what can be learned and accomplished by working
      with an international team. When designing the website, an emphasis was
      put on accessibility. The page was extensively tested with the
      <b
        ><a
          href="https://validator.w3.org/"
          target="_blank"
          class="newlineIgnore"
          >W3C Markup Validator</a
        ></b
      >
      to ensure that it satisfies accessibility standards. The HTML for the page
      fully utilizes semantic tags, and the design and colors for it were
      carefully developed to maintain readability.
