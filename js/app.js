These are admittedly crude drawings, but hopefully they get the point across.

<p class="text">This shows the layout of an outdoor area and some items that can be collected in the game. I have more information about and a prototype of this project in the '<b>WIP UE4 Level</b>' tab.</p>

<div class="idea-image">

<p class="small-text">Explore an ocean.</p>
<p class="text">This game would be about collecting parts of a raft to create your own section of a larger raft as a whole. Everyone would then come together to travel to different islands while working with one another. It's meant to be a relaxing and cozy experience.
<br>I plan to create this using GB Studio.</p>

<div class="idea-image">
<img src="idea-images/TrainNight.png">
</div>
<p class="small-text">A cheap overnight stay.</p>
<p class="text">The planned story of this game is that you're walking around late at night, and you need to find a place to stay. You come across a placed called the 'Subway Motel' and decide to check it out. Learning of its affordable and convenient price, you stay for the night. When you arrive to your 'room', you see why it was so cheap. Your room is a subway platform with a train that roars by every so often.
<br>The goal of this game is to balance your belongings onto your platform so that the train that comes by doesn't sweep your stuff away. Each time the train passes, a new round begins. More of your stuff gets added for each new round, so the challenge is to keep everything by the end of the game. 
<br>This game is based on a dream I had long ago.

<div class="idea-image">
<img src="idea-images/NoTalkCo-op.png">
</div>
<p class="small-text">Work together with limited communication abilities.</p>
<p class="text">The idea for this game is to have two players working together to overcome various challenges. The catch to this is that the players cannot communicate with traditional voice or text chat. They must use the provided in-game solutions, such as stickers to express emotions or ideas, or a rare whiteboard that a player can write on.</p>

<p class="small-text">A racing board game.</p>
<p class="text">A board game for 2-4 players. Players start on the lap space, then race to be the first to make 3 laps. Some spaces that are landed on give items that can boost the player or slow down other players. Players move by flicking a triangle on a device that vaguely resembles an RPM gauge. Players who get boosted get to flick an additional boost gauge, while players who are slowed down need to flick an additional drag gauge.</p>

<p class="small-text">Learn your stories then get together.</p>
<p class="text">Each player plays as a character with their own introduction in the game. They'll each play the character's beginning story and levels, and at the end of it the players will run into each other and form a group. Then they begin to share their own story together in the game. They'll get assigned tasks to accomplish around the land (and even out of the land) by a group for some greater cause. This game can be played with 1-4 players. Some of the replayability comes from choosing a different character for each new game.</p>

<h1>Mix of Ages</h1>
<p>A board game where you travel to the past to fight in a war by using weapons of the future.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p class="small-text">(This game was developed remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, so physical assets do not exist.)</p>
<p class="text">
    Mix of Ages is a 4-player board game where players battle each other to prevent (or succeed in) the rewriting of history. <br>
    Players must defend their castle, claim spaces of land to use its resources, and strategically plan how to move their units and when to use their items.
</p>
</div>

<div class="image map-image">
<img src="images/map.png">
</div>
<p class="small-text">A map of the board.</p>
<p class="text">This game was developed by 3 people. 
<br>My role was the game designer. I worked with the writer and artist to make the gameplay comply with the story. 
<br><br>I developed how the game is played. The game's main mechanics involve: 
<ul>
    <li>Castles</li>
    <li>Land resources</li>
    <li>Player troops</li>
    <li>Card items</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p class="text">
Players attack and defend castles to keep them in the game. If a player's castle is destroyed, then the player is out. Castles begin with a lot of health, so it's unlikely for a player to immediately lose. Castles can be fortified to have better defense as the game progresses.
</p>
<p class="text">
Some spaces on the board contain resources that help the player who claimed the spot. Village spaces produce more units for the player, mines produce more money per round for the player, farms generate helpful items for the player to use, and airports, which were brought from the future, let a player travel from one area of the board to another quickly. 
<br>Players must use the right items to claim a space of land. Players who are trying to take over another player's claimed space can steal it by force. 
<br>One way to win the game is by having the most claimed spaces of land at the end of the game.
</p>
<p class="text">
Players have their own troops to control. They can divide their units however they want to move around the board. The larger a group, the stronger it is. Sometimes, though, it's best to split up. Players move their troops to attack castles or to claim spaces in the land. If a player moves all of their troops away from their castle, it leaves the castle defenseless. Players must think carefully about how they want to divide their units and where to position themselves.
</p>
<p class="text">
Card items are the items players have that they can use on their turn. Card items can be bought with money after every round. Certain card items can be made by combining two certain cards. These cards have various effects, so they can provide offense, defense, or health restoration. The items represented on the cards come from both the past and the future. Some cards feature swords, while others feature ray guns. While items from the future are much more powerful, they are also much more rare. It's up to you when the best time to use one is.
</p>

<div class="double-image">
<div class="image-area">
    <div class="cardcolors"><img src="images/cardcolors.png"></div>
    <div class="carditems"><img src="images/carditems.png"></div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="small-text">Cards are colored to match their type. Cards can be combined to make new cards too.</p>
<p class="text">Cards are color coded to represent the kind of item they have. Blue cards are for defense, green cards are for health restoration, red cards are for offense, and brown cards are for miscellaneous items.</p>
<p class="text">
The above image on the right shows three cards being combined to create a new card. Alcohol, rag, and strength cards can be fused to make a molotov card item. Many card items can only be obtained through fusing, so you're likely to discover a new combination for each new game. 
<br>A list of item combinations is available in the game.
</p>

<div class="image other-image">
<img src="images/pieces.png">
</div>
<p class="small-text">Coins, player tokens, and player flags.</p>
<p class="text">Players place tokens representing their side around the board to show where they have placed their troops. A player's flag is placed on a space that has been claimed by them. The amount of coins generated per round for a player depends on what spaces they have claimed, in addition to a base amount.</p>
</div>

<h1>Development</h1>
<p class="text">The game went through many iterations before it reached its final state. 
<br>The game's development lasted for about a month.
<br><br>Challenges I faced as the game designer include how to balance the game for each player, how player movement on the game board should work, and determining the winning conditions for a player.
</p>
<p class="text">
These issues were overcame through frequent testing and iterating. If some cards were more powerful than others, I would adjust the card appropriately. 
<br><br>The winning conditions were play tested to see if a player could unfairly win, and in the end the best results of winning were to either be the last player standing or by having the most spaced claimed spaces at the end of the game. That way, aggressive players won't be able to steal wins every game if there is more than one way to win.
<br><br>Deciding player movement was the most difficult part. I initially had it too complex by needing to consider the size of a group to determine how many spaces they could move, but in the end a simple dice roll was sufficient to stop it from being too confusing.

<h1>My First Level in UE4</h1>
<p>A basic and simple level.</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
    This was my first attempt at creating a game in Unreal Engine 4. Idea, design, and blueprinting were all from me. 
    <br>All of the sounds were taken from freesound.org. 
    <br>Boat model taken from an online resource.
</p>

<h1>Objective</h1>
<p class="text">
    You must launch the cannon before the falling meteor crashes into your home. 
    <br>Optionally, you can collect and clean moss along the way.
</p>

<h1>Story</h1>
<p class="text">
    You decided to buy a house in the middle of the ocean for some peace and quiet, and better yet, it was cheap! But why was it cheap? You learn that the house is situated on a spot that is prone to meteor impacts.
    <br>Fortunately, the house comes with an Anti-Meteor Cannon Defense System (AMCDS) installed. However, for security, you were too lazy to have to remember a 4-digit password, so you opted into having the cannon locked behind an obstacle course. It hasn't been used in some time, so some moss has grown on some areas.
    <br>You must reach the cannon before the time limit to save your house. Can you do it?

<h1>Second UE4 Project (WIP)</h1>
<p>I don't know what to name it. 
<br>It'll be done eventually.</p>
</div>

<p class="text">
This is my personal project I'm making in Unreal Engine 4. I have a prototype complete. In terms of progress, most of the complex stuff is complete, while the easier functionality should not take too long to add. However, I still need to design and model the levels, so that will be the next big step. 
<br>Imported models and sprite assets were made by me.
<br><br>This project is currently on pause due to school. 
</p>

<h1>Story</h1>
<p class="text">
You are on a trip to the desert with your friends to see a rare red moon. As you arrive to the destination that's near a town, one of your friends tells you to retrieve some items from their car. When you open the door, something runs off with one of the items and scurries into a hole in a rock. You follow the creature in and discover what secrets hide under the town...
</p>

<h1>Features</h1>
<p class="text">
A short experience planned to consist of:
<ul>
    <li>A lighthearted story.</li>
    <li>2D characters.</li>
    <li>Small puzzles.</li>
    <li>Items such as:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>A sticky hand to grab distant items or activate distance switches.</li>
        <li>A scooter to move quickly.</li>
        <li>An umbrella to fall slowly.</li>
        <li>Spring shoes to jump high.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>And the usage of multiple items at once to combine their abilities.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Multiplayer Unity Game</h1>
<p>3 players against 1.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p class="text">
This game was made by a team of 4 members (including myself). 
<br>It's a game where 3 players need to outrun and defend themselves from the 1 enemy player. 
The enemy player has to chase and catch the running players, but the running players can use traps and doors to slow the chasing player down. 
The buttons are only on one side of the door, so you're able to cut off players who are chasing you.
<br>The game was networked using Photon Engine. 
</p>

<h1>My Contribution</h1>
<p class="text">
I developed the doors in this game. Every door is tied to a button that opens and closes the door. 
The button is green when the door is open, and turns red when it's closed. 
The buttons and doors are networked so that the toggle occurs in every player's instance of the game; players can see other players opening and closing doors. 
<br><br>I also sourced all the audio in this game, both the sound effects and the music (though I did not implement them).
<br>The music is from <a href="https://incompetech.com/"><b>incompetech.com</b></a> 
and the sound effects were taken from <a href="https://freesound.org/"><b>freesound.org</b></a>
</p>

<h1>Showcase</h1>
<p class="text">
Gameplay footage. Again, the door functionality was made by me, and all of the sounds and music were found by me. 
<br>(Gameplay begins at 1:26. Also, my voice is not present in this. Commentary is provided by the other 3 team members.)
